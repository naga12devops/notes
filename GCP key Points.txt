1.Autoscaling dynamically creates or deletes VMs to meet the group target 
2.Autoscaling adds or removes instances in the group to maintain this level of CPU usage on each instance
3. COOl DOWN TIME:
   	How long to wait before collecting information from a new instance. 
	This should be at least the time it takes to initialize the instance. 
	To find the minimum, create an instance from the same image and note how long it takes to start.
4.AUTO HEALING: 
	Autohealing allows recreating VM instances when needed. 
	You can use a health check to recreate a VM instance if the health check finds it unresponsive. 
	If you don't select a health check, Compute Engine will recreate VM instances only when they're not running.
